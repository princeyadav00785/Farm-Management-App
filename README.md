Real-time Updates: The app provides real-time weather updates based on the farmer's location, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
Forecast: Farmers can view weather forecasts for the upcoming days, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed, helping them plan their farming activities effectively.
City Selection: Users can search for weather information in different cities or regions, making it easier to monitor conditions across multiple locations.
3. Plant Health Prediction
Sub-features:
Leaf Image Recognition: Using the device's camera, farmers can capture images of plant leaves for analysis.
Machine Learning Model: The app utilizes a sophisticated machine learning model, powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to analyze leaf images and predict the health status of plants.
Prediction Feedback: Farmers receive instant feedback on the health of their plants, including any signs of disease, pest infestation, or nutrient deficiencies.
Recommendations: Based on the analysis, the app may provide recommendations for treatment or management practices to improve plant health and productivity.
Additional Functionalities
Authentication
Secure authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the app, protecting sensitive information and transactions. Users can register their accounts or log in securely using email/password or social media accounts, with Redux managing the user authentication state.
Search Functionality

Address Management
Farmers can store and manage their addresses within the app, simplifying the checkout process for seed purchases. Users can add, edit, or delete addresses as needed, ensuring accurate delivery information for orders, with Redux managing the address state.
Cart Management
A user-friendly cart management system allows farmers to add items to their cart, review their selections, and proceed with the checkout process seamlessly. Users can easily adjust quantities, remove items, or apply discount codes before finalizing their purchases, with Redux managing the cart state throughout the process.
Favorites
Users can mark products as favorites for quick access and future reference. The favorites feature allows users to create personalized lists of preferred items, making it convenient to revisit and purchase them later.
